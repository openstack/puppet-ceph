# == Class: ceph::osds
#
# Class wrapper for the benefit of scenario_node_terminus
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*args*] A Ceph osds config hash
#   Optional.
#
# [*defaults*] A config hash
#   Optional. Defaults to a empty hash
#
# **DEPRECATED PARAMS**
#
# [*pid_max*] Value for pid_max. Defaults to undef. Optional.
#   For OSD nodes it is recommended that you raise pid_max above the
#   default value because you may hit the system max during
#   recovery. The recommended value is the absolute max for pid_max: 4194303
