Overview
--------

The ceph module is intended to leverage all [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) has to offer and allow for a wide range of use case. Although hosted on the OpenStack infrastructure, it does not require to sign a CLA nor is it restricted to OpenStack users. It benefits from a structured development process that helps federate the development effort. Each feature is tested with integration tests involving virtual machines to show that it performs as expected when used with a realistic scenario.

Module Description
------------------

The ceph module deploys a [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) cluster ( MON, OSD ), the [Cephfs](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/cephfs/) file system and the [RadosGW](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/man/8/radosgw/) object store. It provides integration with various environments ( OpenStack ... ) and components to be used by third party puppet modules that depend on a Ceph cluster.

Setup

Implementation
--------------

A [blueprint](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Puppet/ceph-blueprint) contains an inventory of what is desirable. It was decided to start from scratch and implement one module at a time.

Limitations
-----------

We follow the OS compatibility of Ceph. With the release of infernalis this is currently:

* CentOS 7 or later
* Debian Jessie 8.x or later
* Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 or later
* Fedora 22 or later

Use Cases
---------

* [I want to try this module, heard of ceph, want to see it in action](USECASES.md#i-want-to-try-this-module,-heard-of-ceph,-want-to-see-it-in-action)
* [I want to operate a production cluster](USECASES.md#i-want-to-operate-a-production-cluster)
* [I want to run benchmarks on three new machines](USECASES.md#i-want-to-run-benchmarks-on-three-new-machines)

Development
-----------

```
git clone https://github.com/openstack/puppet-ceph.git
